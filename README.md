# Sprint Challenge: JavaScript Fundamentals

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a survey of problems. This Sprint explored JavaScript Fundamentals. During this Sprint, you studied array methods, this keyword, prototypes, and class syntax. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by completing a survey of JavaScript problems.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in JavaScript fundamentals.

> You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Description

You will notice there are several JavaScript files being brought into the index.html file.  Each of those files contain JavaScript problems you need to solve.  If you get stuck on something, skip over it and come back to it later.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you should have a console full of correct responses to the problems given.

## Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your team lead

1. Briefly compare and contrast `.forEach` & `.map` (2-3 sentences max)

The most significant difference between .forEach and .map is that map returns a new array of elements while in turn passing each element back to the callback. 

2. Explain the difference between a callback and a higher order function.

A callback function is passed into another function as an argument, that is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of action. 

A higher order function is a function that returns a function as opposed to a simple value.

3. What is closure?

A closure is where an inner function has access to the outer function's variables. A closure has three scope chains and access to it's own scope. Variables are defined between curly brackets and it has access to the outer function's variables. 

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

Principle 1 (Window/Global Object Binding): when in the global scope the value of 'this' will be the window object. 

Principle 2 (Implicit Binding): whenever a preceding dot calls a function, the object before the dot is this. 

Principle 3 (New Binding): whenever a constructor function is used 'this' refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by contructor function. 

Principle 4 (Explicit Binding): whenever we use javascript's call or apply method 'this' is explicity defined

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

super() function makie it trivial to bind our classes togther to achieve some simple oject inheritance. super() tells a parent constructor to be concerned with the child's atrributes and abstracts away. 

### Task 1 - Project Set up

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:
Make sure you clone the branch that the TK links to: the vnext branch, NOT master!

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add TL as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of Repo (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new Branch on the clone: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Create a pull request before you start working on the project requirements.  You will continuously push your updates throughout the project.
- [ ] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE
- [ ] Implement the project on your Branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.



### Task 2 - Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

**Pro tip for this challenge: If something seems like it isn't working locally, copy and paste your code up to codepen and take another look at the console.**

#### Task A: Objects and Arrays

Test your knowledge of advanced array methods and callbacks.
* [ ] Use the [arrays-callbacks.js](challenges/arrays-callbacks.js) link to get started.  Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task B: Closure

This challenge takes a look at closures as well as scope. 
* [ ] Use the [closure.js](challenges/closure.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task C: Prototypes

Create constructors, bind methods, and create cuboids in this prototypes challenge.
* [ ] Use the [prototypes.js](challenges/prototypes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task D: Classes

Once you have completed the prototypes challenge, it's time to convert all your hard work into classes.
* [ ] Use the [classes.js](challenges/classes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

In your solutions, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 3 - Stretch Problems

There are a few stretch problems found throughout the files, don't work on them until you are finished with MVP requirements!

## Submission Format

Follow these steps for completing your project:

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo).
- [ ] Add your team lead as a Reviewer on the Pull-request
- [ ] TL then will count the HW as done by  merging the branch back into master.
